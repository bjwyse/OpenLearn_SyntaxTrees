This resource contains syntax tree representations of an instance of the OpenLearn educational resource from mid-2009. OpenLearn is an online educational resource created by The Open University and available at http://www.openlearn.co.uk.

The trees were created by the Stanford Parser which is available at http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml.

The resource was originally converted for use in the NLP sub-field of Question Generation (QG) but could be useful for other AI research.
